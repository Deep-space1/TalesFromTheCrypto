In this repositort, I have applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I ahve also applied fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.
